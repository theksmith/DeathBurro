DeathBurro 1.0: RESCUE MANUAL: Important Overview!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- there is a USB port on a cable in donkey's mouth (tucked up towards the top), use that port with this USB drive and the instructions below.

-- the Chumby factory interface has a control panel and also loads "widgets" from chumby.com. the default widget *should* just be a black screen telling you it's the default widget for DeathBurro.
-- if this factory interface is running, press the ass button to switch between the control panel and widget views.
-- once on the control panel view, there are several options. most important is the hidden screen at: control panel > settings > chumby info > faint PI symbol in upper right corner
-- the hidden screen has the reboot/off buttons. with a battery in donkey, and this factory interface running, this hidden screen is the only way to reboot/shutdown donkey.

DeathBurro 1.0: RESCUE MANUAL: Complete Wipe-n-Restore
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RESCUE STEP 1 - perform a complete Chumby factory reset.

-- ! if at any point during this step you are prompted that an update is available to download, respond NO or LATER 
-- you *could* install any update to get latest software and then skip STEP 2, but if Chumby has made significant changes then our final customization step may not install correctly.
1. be sure the USB drive is removed from the donkey.
2. reboot or power up donkey (see Important Overview section above and/or USER MANUAL).
3. touch the screen and continue to press while donkey is rebooting.
4. continue pressing the screen until you see a the message "Loading Special Options"
5. once the "Special Options" menu appears, tap the "Restore factory settings" button.
6. acknowledge you are sure you want to do this.
7. donkey will reboot, and restore the factory Chumby partition, wiping out all customizations.
8. after the reboot, a tour animation will play, you may tap the "Exit" button any time.
9. select the "Never Show Tour Again" button.
10. follow the prompts for touchscreen calibration.
11. follow the prompts to setup a WiFi connection (note the IP when done in case you want to remote in later).
12. follow the prompts to configure your timezone (tap the map multiple times to zoom in until you are able to select your nearest city).
13. when everything is complete, the default DeathBurro widget should load from chumby (see Important Overview section above), or if no WiFi is available, a simple clock will show.
14. continue to RESCUE STEP 2


RESCUE STEP 2 - install the Chumby factory update.

-- ! again, if at any point during this step you are prompted that an update is available to download, respond NO or LATER 
1. put the USB Helper Drive in your computer.
2. be sure there are no files on the root of the USB drive.
3. copy the "update.tgz" file from the USB/rescue folder to the root of the USB Drive.
4. eject the USB drive from your computer and plug it into the USB port in donkey's mouth.
5. reboot or power up donkey (see Important Overview section above and/or USER MANUAL).
6. touch the screen and continue to press while donkey is rebooting.
7. continue pressing the screen until you see a the message "Loading Special Options"
8. once the "Special Options" menu appears, tap the "Install Updates" button.
9. choose "Install from USB flash drive"
10. donkey will install an update, reboot, and then install a second part of the update. you must let it install both updates!
11. you *may* have to configure touchscreen/WiFi/timezone again, please do so.
12. when done, you'll briefly see the message "Update successfully completed" and then the default widget should load (see Important Overview section above).
13. reboot donkey once more (see Important Overview section above), and follow any prompts until you again see the default widget or clock.
14. continue to RESCUE STEP 3


RESCUE STEP 3 - install the DeathBurro 1.0 modifications.

1. remove the USB drive from donkey.
2. put the USB Helper Drive in your computer.
3. delete the "update.tgz" file from the root of the USB drive.
4. copy the "debugchumby_full_restore" file from the USB/rescue folder to the root of the USB Drive.
6. rename the copied file to just "debugchumby".
7. eject the USB drive from your computer and plug it into the USB port in donkey's mouth.
8. reboot or power up donkey (see Important Overview section above and/or USER MANUAL).
9. you should see normal startup screen/animations and then a black screen with blue text. the rescue script is then running.
10. the rescue script can take a long time (maybe up to 20 minutes), please be patient and don't restart while it's working.
11. once the rescue script is complete, either the default widget will load or *maybe* the DeathBurro Main Interface.
12. regardless of which loads, remove the USB drive and reboot donkey one final time (see Important Overview section above and/or USER MANUAL).
13. on the final boot, you should see the DeathBurro opening animation instead of the Chumby factory opener, and then the DeathBurro Main Interface should load and be fully functional.
14. ! be sure to place the USB drive back in your computer and delete the "debugchumby" file from the root to restore the drive to its original state.


FINAL NOTES

-- ! after a rescue, donkey is completely un-secured. SSHD is running and the default root account has no password.
-- ! please immediately remote in and setup some security (see the DEV MANUAL).

-- you can always plug in a USB keyboard and the screen should pull up a tiny shell console.

-- if none of the above fixes a bricked donkey..
-- you will need to take the cover off of donkey to remove the microSD card from the main system board (see the DEV MANUAL for more info).
-- there is a factory image of the entire microSD card in this USB drive's USB/dev/resources/chumbyone_microsd_image folder.
-- there is also a utility in that folder for Windows to write the image to the microSD card (or Google how to do it from Linux).
-- re-writing the entire card with this factory image should replace the RESCUE STEP 1 instructions above, continue to RESCUE STEP 2.
